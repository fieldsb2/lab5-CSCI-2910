I encountered the error that my JSON response is not parsed at all, and will need to be separated within a list so that it can have proper and readable output.

I encountered the problem that I will need to create a fruit class with all properties to properly output the fruit's information.

I encountered the issue that the fruit class that I created is not being recognized within my main method. This was corrected by fixing the namespace so that they match.

Encountered an issue where I was trying to serialize and deserialize, but realized I only need to deserialize.
