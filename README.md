I encountered the error that my JSON response is not parsed at all, and will need to be separated within a list so that it can have proper and readable output.

I encountered the problem that I will need to create a fruit class with all properties to properly output the fruit's information.

I encountered the issue that the fruit class that I created is not being recognized within my main method. This was corrected by fixing the namespace so that they match.

Encountered an issue where I was trying to serialize and deserialize, but realized I only need to deserialize.

Encountered an issue where the properties did not want to print out after being pulled from the JSON, but then realized I could use the JSonPropertyName to set what the name of the property is in JSON versus my program due to casing issues.

Encountered an issue where calories did not properly pull from the JSON due to it being a different data type than my dictionary was taking, so i resolved this by making it a float.
